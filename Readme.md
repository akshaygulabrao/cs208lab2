# CS208 Docker Containers

## Problem Statement
In this assignment, you have to use a client-server socket program using TCP sockets
from Assignment 1 and containerize your applications. There will be two containers, one
for the server and another for the client application. You can create two containers in the
same machine.

## Mistakes this lab
1. Used local Windows for Docker instead of cloudlab Ubuntu
2. Could not get client to pass the IP address. The IP address was fetched using gethostname cmd.

## Thoughts on Lab
In terms of difficulty, I would rate this lab as 4/10. It took me approximately 6 hours (in 1 sitting) to complete. Not terribly difficult for a CS lab.
